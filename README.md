## what is muschema

Think about what is a schema?

schema can be seen as how you describe and manipulate a piece of data.

While typescript allow you to define the type that can constrain object creation when coding, Muschema provide you a number of more convenient operation in term of object creation, assigning, comparing, cloning. and those are just the very basic usage of Muschema.
